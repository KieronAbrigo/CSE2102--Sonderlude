GENERAL INFORMATION

This database dubbed the Inmate Management Information System (IMIS) is necessary 
for the smooth and efficient management of the Two Thousand plus (2000+) criminal 
population incarcerated within five (5) locations managed by the Guyana Prison Service (GPS). 
The IMIS will replace the current inefficient paper based system that are prone to mistakes, 
and will provide faster reporting and information retrieval as well as more precise data management.
